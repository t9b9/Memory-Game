# Memory-Game
After clicking two cards, before being able to click the next two card, there is a one second 
gap to allow player to remeber the flipped cards.

Furthur implementation:
1. Add a timer, so when timeout there is a boom explode animation.
2. If there are continue matches, text animation "Good", "Excellent",
and "Killer" will popup in the playing scence.
3. More difficulty levels can be chosen (more cards or shorter timer)
